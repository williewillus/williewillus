### williewillus

Please see my website [here](https://www.vincent-lee.net) for more about me and extra content I'd like to share.

Going forward, many of my projects will instead be hosted on [SourceHut](https://sr.ht/~williewillus/), a code forge
buitlt on open source and standard technologies. The social gamification of GitHub, as well the increasing centralization of what
is supposed to be a *distributed* version control system has grown off-putting to me.

If there is a special need for a project to be hosted here, let me know and I will set it up to be mirrored from SourceHut.

Thanks for visiting and enjoy!
